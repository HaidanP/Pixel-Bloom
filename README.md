# 🌸 Pixel Bloom

**Ever wondered how AI creates stunning images from pure noise?**

Pixel Bloom is an interactive journey through the fascinating world of diffusion models - the technology behind DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion. Watch as random static transforms into beautiful images, step by step.

## ✨ What You'll Discover

🎯 **The Magic Unfold**: See how a neural network learns to "denoise" its way from chaos to art  
🧠 **Neural Architecture**: Dive deep into U-Net - the brain behind the magic  
📊 **Noise Schedules**: Understand how different noise patterns affect generation  
🔄 **Training Secrets**: Learn how these models actually get trained  
⚡ **Interactive Learning**: Don't just read about it - play with it!

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Get the code
git clone https://github.com/HaidanP/Pixel-Bloom.git
cd Pixel-Bloom

# Install & run
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and prepare to have your mind blown! 🤯
